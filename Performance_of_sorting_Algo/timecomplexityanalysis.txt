	CASES:
	Worst Case:
		Worst case occurs when the array is sorted in descending order  i.e

					INTERPRETATION FROM GRAPHS	
	
	As we see  from the graph that both curves are of degree 2 but curve of bubble
	sort is above the curve of selection sort because the constant P which appears
	with n^2 in selection sort is less than the constant A with n^2 in bubble sort.
	Both graphs are quadratic .
	
	Theoritical complexity assures that the curve for bubble and selection sort are
	quadratic .
	
	Using practical complexity when we plot the graph we observe similar behaviour .
	Hence Theoritical and practical complexity matches .
